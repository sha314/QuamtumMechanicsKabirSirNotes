\chapter{sheet-20 : Time Independent Perturbation}

The major task in any practical application of quantum mechanics is to solve the eigenvalue equation of the Hamiltonian $H$ of the system. Considering the bound states, the eigenvalues of $H$ are discrete and corresponding to each eigenvalue there may be one or several linearly independent eigengectors. The eigenvalue equation, i.e., the time independent Schr\"{o}dinger equation is 
\begin{equation}
	H \ket{E_n} = E_n \ket{E_n}
	\label{chapter20.eqn1-intro
\end{equation}

Except for few special cases the eigenvalue equation cannot be solved exactly. The eqaution then has to be solved numerically, or approximate methods have to be devised to solve the equation to any desired order of accuracy.
